#### Hello! On this page, I will outline the current projects I am working on. These range from lighthearted pursuits, like short stories and hobby projects (including this very website), to more serious efforts related to my work or career.

The main work I have produced is the AI Constantine Research Database which takes in a PDF of a scholarly source, analyzes it, and outputs the title, author name, year published, attaches unique tags, and also generates bulleted "Key Points" and "Relevance to Imperial Legitimacy." The user may also input their own custom analysis section to generate bulleted points like "Key Points." Of course, the user may edit or delete each analyzed source card.

In the Analytics tab, the unique tags generated by the AI will create a network diagram showing the overlap between all the articles and the topics they cover. Individual tags are also present, and one may see which articles have what tags. Finally, the AI search allows the user to search for any useful information they would like to glean from an uploaded article, complete with direct citations and page numbers.

I used Google AI Studio to create the program and plan on soon hosting it on Vercel or GitHub Pages after running it on VS Code. Unfortunately, taking it off of the Google AI Studio website will require me to purchase Gemini API tokens. When and if I do, I will make it available here.

Another project I have been working on is "Eusebiask", and, if I'm being completely honest, I enjoyed working on this one a lot more. Eusebiask is an AI chatbot version of Eusebius that answers any inquiries a user may have with his *Church History* and *Life of Constantine*. Eusebiask has a colorful personality suitable for a fourth-century church historian. Every session is complete with an opening remark, among my favorites are "Simeon sits on a pillar for thirty years and they call him holy. I sit at a desk for thirty years and they call me a historian. Location, location, location" and "Origen wrote over 6,000 works. I'm convinced he never slept, ate, or... well, after the castration incident, we know what else he wasn't doing." A bit too edgy? As with the database, I made this using Google AI Studio and plan on making it public soon if possible.
