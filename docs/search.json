    "text": "Hello! On this page, I will outline the current projects I am working on. These range from lighthearted pursuits, like short stories and hobby projects (including this very website), to more serious efforts related to my work or career.\nThe main work I have produced is the AI Constantine Research Database which takes in a PDF of a scholarly source, analyzes it, and outputs the title, author name, year published, attaches unique tags, and also generates bulleted “Key Points” and “Relevance to Imperial Legitimacy.” The user may also input their own custom analysis section to generate bulleted points like “Key Points.” Of course, the user may edit or delete each analyzed source card.\nIn the Analytics tab, the unique tags generated by the AI will create a network diagram showing the overlap between all the articles and the topics they cover. Individual tags are also present, and one may see which articles have what tags. Finally, the AI search allows the user to search for any useful information they would like to glean from an uploaded article, complete with direct citations and page numbers.\nI used Google AI Studio to create the program and plan on soon hosting it on Vercel or GitHub Pages after running it on VS Code. Unfortunately, taking it off of the Google AI Studio website will require me to purchase Gemini API tokens. When and if I do, I will make it available here.\n\n\n\nExample of the network diagram based on AI-generated tags.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A demonstration of the functionalities of the database. (Play button on top left).\n\n\n\nAnother project I have been working on is “Eusebiask”, and, if I’m being completely honest, I enjoyed working on this one a lot more. Eusebiask is an AI chatbot version of Eusebius that answers any inquiries a user may have with his Church History and Life of Constantine. Eusebiask has a colorful personality suitable for a fourth-century church historian. Every session is complete with an opening remark, among my favorites are “Simeon sits on a pillar for thirty years and they call him holy. I sit at a desk for thirty years and they call me a historian. Location, location, location” and “Origen wrote over 6,000 works. I’m convinced he never slept, ate, or… well, after the castration incident, we know what else he wasn’t doing.” A bit too edgy? As with the database, I made this using Google AI Studio and plan on making it public soon if possible.\n\n\nA short demonstration of Eusebiask\n\nIn Deo Speramus\nAnno Domini MMXXV"

    "text": "Hello! My name is Yechan D. Kim, and I’m an undergraduate student at Brown University, double-concentrating in Applied Mathematics–Economics and International and Public Affairs. I’ve excelled in coursework spanning data computing, cybersecurity, mathematics, and religious history. Previously, I served as president and editor-in-chief of my high school’s newsletter and interned at Samsung International, where I gained hands-on experience with one of the world’s leading AI innovators. Currently based in San Diego, you can often find me reading medieval history, pondering theology, debating philosophy, or scrolling through the “issues” tab on GitHub—usually with a Dr. Pepper in hand.\nCurrently, I am working with UCSD Professor Edward J. Watts, Chair in Byzantine Greek History and Co-Director of the Center for Hellenic Studies, on various AI projects to assist with his research. In particular, I developed an AI-powered database that summarizes documents and extracts key information to automatically generate a network diagram and a search feature. This AI search allows users to query any uploaded scholarly article and provides results supplemented with direct quotes. Furthermore, I developed a tool called “Eusebiask” in which an AI version of the church historian Eusebius responds to inquiries based on his Life of Constantine and Church History."

    "text": "My full name in small seal script and the logo of this site.\n\n\nAs you may have deduced from my logo, main page description, and the picture of Aristotle, I am absolutely fascinated by different cultures, histories, and ideas. I would consider myself an aspiring polymath (a fancy way of saying I am non-committal) as I love to study everything about this world, and often there is such a strong connection between subjects that it does not beget much labor in researching multiple fields at once. However, if there were one area that I would gladly study for the rest of my life, it would be history: specifically, the history of ideas, such as the history of mathematics, philosophy, and… well… history itself.\nCurrently, I am trying to do a deeper study into mathematics, specifically more abstract algebra and almost contemplative mathematical topics such as category theory, the foundations of set theory, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, and the philosophy of mathematics—topics that blur the line between logic and metaphysics. As history yields to interpretation and philosophy drifts through shifting truths, mathematics stands firm from age to age.\nI am an avid reader and am currently going through the works of Thomas Paine and a biography of Justinian by Peter Sarris. Make no mistake: I far prefer fiction over non-fiction as all sensible men do, but I supposed that it would be profitable to knock out some heartier works this summer. My favorite book is Crime and Punishment (very basic, I know, but it maintains a nostalgic grip on my heart), and the most inspiring work I’ve ever read is Seneca’s letters. My long-term goal is to finish War and Peace and the Bible by the end of this year.\nI am as much a writer as I am a reader, though I’ve had few chances lately to stretch my vocabulary, something I hope to change by joining the Brown Daily Herald soon.\nI promise you I’m not just a hermit recluse, as you may have concluded so far! I run at least three miles daily and enjoy hiking across Southern California. Furthermore, I try my best to eat as naturally as possible and hit the gym ideally three times a week. I enjoy socializing with people of every creed and culture, and am currently learning Japanese to help me in this endeavor.\nSpeaking of which, I also enjoy watching anime, playing JRPGs, and reading Japanese literature. I recently finished Silence by Shusaku Endo, which quickly became one of my favorite Asian novels and books overall. Among my favorite anime are Vinland Saga, Mob Psycho 100,and Hunter x Hunter, while my favorite JRPG is Persona 5.\nI am a Presbyterian Christian (aka a Reformed or Evangelical Catholic, as the reformers themselves would put it) and attend a Korean-American congregation. I enjoy deepening my understanding of the Christian faith and have been particularly inspired by St. Augustine’s Confessions and Martin Luther’s The Bondage of the Will, the latter of which has had a significant influence on my rhetorical style. Alongside this, I also strive to learn more about other faiths and belief systems, particularly Islam and Eastern religions, and have taken a course in Classical Chinese Philosophy to deepen my understanding.\nLet all that you do be done in love.\n-1 Corinthians 16:14\n\n\n\nSøren Kierkegaard, a favorite philosopher-theologian of mine and my Instagram profile picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Manning (Princeton 1762), the first president of Brown University and a devout Calvinist minister of First Baptist Church in America. He was an important player in the American Revolution and sought greater religious freedom for Quakers and Jews.\n\n\nIn Deo Speramus\nAnno Domini MMXXV"
